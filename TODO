In no particular order, here is what need to be done:

- Game idle animation. I was thinking of just using a single white face moving
  from side to side (searchlight searshing for something).
- Win/Lose animations. No idea here but I guess it needs to be something flashy.
- Make the marker fade to white/off when it is hit by the searchlight.
- Test, test, test to validate gameplay mechanics.
- Some other stuff I probably forgot.
