The higher the number of Blinks, the more difficult it will be to win. The higher the number of players, the easier it will be to win. It is up to you to find a balance.

After loading the game on your Blinks, they will all switch to searchlight animation. Cluster all Blinks together then remove one Blink per player (you can also play alone by using at least 2 Blinks yourself).

Single click each of the player Blinks and they will stop the animation and show a single searchlight face. Then click any Blink in the cluster and that will be your starting position.

Your pet bat (yeah, why not?) wandered into your basement and as luck would have it a fuse blows when you go after it and the basement becomes pitch black. Your (and your friends') task is no locate the bat and capture it. Obviously without hurting the poor creature.

To do that, you only have your searchlights which is nice because it just happens to be the only thing your pet is affraid of as it hates the strong light they emit.

Use your searchlights to try to corner your pet until it has nowhere else to move and can then be safely captured. The bat is always moving around but it will never intentionally cross the path of your searchlight light unless it is moving head-on to it. If you manage to point it in the direction of your bat, you will be able to see where it is but it will quickly move somewhere else (you will see a hint of where it went.

To use the searchlight, just connect it to any Blink in the cluster. It will create a path of light all the way accros the cluster, separating it in 2 regions. The bat will be unable to switch regions unless it can not avoid it (again, because it is moving head-on in the direction of the light). Other players can them connect their searchlights to try to narrow down where the bat is and then start cornering it.

# End Game

The game finishes either when you manage to win by cornering the bat so it can not move anywhere else, the bat makes things easier and moves head on towards you (bot are win conditions and the cluster will become all blue) or when the time (1 minute) runs out (the cluster will turn all red and you lost).

After the game ends, just click the cluster to reset it and start again.
